/*
This will be a page describing Solid and the idea of "you can do anything with anything when it comes to your data.

It will explain a little bit about data privacy... a bit of advertisement...

Built on what Tim has done. Adding three additional things
1) right click feature
2) Extend drag and drop to work across data types...  e.g. dragging a contact to an event to invite them,
    dragging a document to a contact to share it with them...
3) Make a configurable "workspace" and view.
